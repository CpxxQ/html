                Programming is like the wizardry behind all the cool stuff we use every dayâ€”apps. <br> Like: websites, games, you name it! Think of it as the secret code that makes
                <br> everything work like magic. <br><br> The people who program in their everyday life is like a superhero for the digital world. <br> They've got really good skills in 
                not just one, but three or more languages! <br> It's like speaking multiple languages, but for computers. <br><br> Some of the programming languages are at the top 
                right corner next to the image. They're like badges for the developers, if the know the language. Even though there's loads of languages <br> out there, 
                they all have a different meaning and other functions.
